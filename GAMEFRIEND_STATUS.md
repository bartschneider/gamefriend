# GameFriend Status Update

## Local Embeddings Implementation

We've successfully implemented local embedding generation using sentence-transformers and FAISS for efficient retrieval. Here's an overview of the changes:

### New Modules

1. **embeddings_manager.py**:
   - Uses sentence-transformers to generate embeddings locally
   - Supports chunking text based on semantic boundaries
   - Provides efficient vector search using FAISS
   - Caches embeddings to avoid re-computation
   - Batches embedding operations for performance

2. **CLI Tools**:
   - Added `python -m gamefriend embeddings` command to generate embeddings for guides
   - Support for generating embeddings for specific games or all games

### Modified Components

1. **guide_manager.py**:
   - Integrated with embeddings_manager for seamless operation
   - Automatically generates embeddings when a new guide is downloaded
   - Provides guide context retrieval based on semantic search

2. **chat/__init__.py**:
   - Updated to use local embeddings instead of the Mistral API
   - Improved error handling for cases where embeddings don't exist
   - More robust retrieval of relevant context

### Benefits

1. **Cost Reduction**:
   - No need to make API calls to the Mistral embeddings endpoint
   - Eliminates the rate limiting problems we were experiencing

2. **Performance**:
   - Pre-computed embeddings are stored locally for instant retrieval
   - FAISS provides blazing-fast similarity search even with many guides

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Can switch embedding models as needed
   - Customizable chunking strategies
   - Control over the vector dimension and search parameters

### Usage

1. **Generate Embeddings**:
   ```bash
   # For all games
   python -m gamefriend embeddings
   
   # For a specific game
   python -m gamefriend embeddings --game "Soul Blazer" --platform "snes"
   ```

2. **Using in Chat**:
   The chat functionality automatically uses the local embeddings when available. If embeddings don't exist for a game, it will try to generate them on the fly.

### Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile and optimize the chunking strategy
   - Consider hierarchical retrieval for large guides

2. **Testing**:
   - Create more comprehensive tests with real game guides
   - Benchmark search quality compared to the Mistral API

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Update frontend to show embedding status
   - Add progress indicators for long-running embedding generation tasks
